# learning_protobuf

The goal of this project is to learn protobufs by creating a protobuf reader/writer. The first iteration should be focused on just reading and writing messages to files. Once that is completed, I think the next goal will be to stream messages between a client and a server. The final stretch goal for this project would be to create a wasm build of the rust client.
